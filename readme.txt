* **Instantaneous translation** of communication between your agent and your customer.
            * No need to hire a Customer Service Agent per language effectivey, reducing your cost

* **There's no feedback form after chat ends**. Most customers, especially angry ones close this form. Instead our system runs A.I/Analytics over the entire conversation, extrapolate the **nouns** discussed and determine:
            * *Product/Services analytics* at the end of the chat conversation 
            * *Customer Analytics* to determine how your customers feel about your product or service 
            * *Customer Service Rep analytics* to determine how effective your agents are

* **Get instant triggers via SMS/Email** whenever your customer experience goes bad. 
            * This allows you to save your customer relationship. 

* **Improve your sales turnover by focusing on analytics** and know what matters most to your customers

* **Download our mobile app (Android/IOS)** for your customer service agents, which allows engagement with your customers on your website.
